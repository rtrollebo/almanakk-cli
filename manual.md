# Manual

*almanakk-cli* is a command-line program for calculation of solar ephemeris (sunrise and sunset for a given geographical location and date), celestial phases (phases of the moon) and calendar events derived from celestial phase events. 

Almanakk (Norwegian for almanac) is an astronomical calendar, containing ephemeris of celestial objects.

*almanakk-cli* is a client program for the *almanakk-lib* library (currently, the library is not in a public repo).

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                              |
| :---      | :---                                                     |
| lat       | Latitude of the geographical location (decimal degrees)  |
| lon       | Longitude of the geographical location (decimal degrees) |
| timezone  | Timezone (optional) for output time (integer)            |
|           |                                                          |

The current date (and timezone if not provided) is determined from the system clock. 

## Ephemeris Data Product

| Parameter | Description                                 |
| :---      | :---                                        |
| sunrise   | Time of sunrise, in unit of hour and minute |
| sunset    | Time of sunset, in unit of hour and minute  |
| Δ rise    | Daily change in sunrise time, in seconds.   |
| Δ set     | Daily change in sunset time, in seconds.    |

`Δ rise` is < 0 between winter and summer solstice (approximately), whereas `Δ set` is vice versa.

## Celestial Phase Data Product

### Celestial Phase 

The current phase of the moon. The phases are the time durations between each 4 phase events. From the start of the lunar cycle to the end, they are as follows: 
Waxing crescent, Waxing gibbous, Waning gibbous, Waning crescent.

### Celestial Phase Events

Date and time of next phase event. Output minutes are rounded to the nearest 5.
Currently, only the phases of the Moon are calculated. But, phases of other celestial bodies such as planets may be added in the future.
The phase cycle contains 4 events:  New, first quarter, full and last quarter. `almanakk-cli` displays the lunar phase events, ordered by date of occurrence.
